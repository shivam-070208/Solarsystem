# Solar System 3D Visualization

A beautiful interactive 3D model of the Solar System built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Explore the planets, view their orbits, and learn interesting facts about each planet. Includes smooth camera controls, animated orbits, and a pause/start feature.

## Features

- **3D Solar System**: Realistic rendering of the Sun and 8 planets, each with unique textures and orbits.
- **Planet Info**: Hover over a planet to see its name and a short description in a bottom-center info box.
- **Camera Focus**: Click any planet to smoothly zoom and center the camera on it.
- **Pause/Start Animation**: Use the button at the bottom right to pause or resume the planetary motion.
- **Responsive Controls**: Zoom, pan, and rotate the view with your mouse (OrbitControls).
- **Customizable**: Easily add more planets, change textures, or update planet info.
